# Daily Work Planner/Scheduler

## Description

I have been tasked with creating a daily planner/scheduler application that uses jQuery and moment.js library.

I was tasked to use jQuery tool along with moment.js to build dynamic planner by creating/inserting elements, storing and retrieving these values from localStorage and update them. Then I have used moment.js to determine the current time, working hours and differences: past (grey), present(red), and future(green) to reflect the time on the app.

Link to moment.js: [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/)
